iris flower classification using multi class svm algorithm
The goal of mining the iris data set is to find patterns by analysing the iris plant's sepal and petal sizes, and to determine the class of iris plants by studying the patterns. Future years will allow for the individual identification of different blooms utilising classification and pattern recognition. Unmistakably, it is said that a classification model would be the kind of relationship that is being mined from the iris information.
